### Introduction to Ethical Considerations in AI

This section introduces the concept of ethics and its importance in the context of AI. It discusses why ethical considerations are critical in AI development and usage, and highlights common ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, accountability, and transparency.

**Examples:**
- Consider the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. What ethical issues might arise regarding privacy and consent?

### Ethical Frameworks in AI

Explore various ethical frameworks used in AI, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. Each framework's application in AI development is discussed to provide a structured approach to ethical decision-making.

**Examples:**
- Utilitarianism: Evaluating AI's impact on maximizing overall happiness, such as AI applications in healthcare.

### Privacy Concerns in AI

Dive into issues surrounding data privacy in AI systems. Discuss the collection and use of personal data by AI technologies, potential breaches, and the importance of consent and transparency. Examine regulatory frameworks such as GDPR.

**Examples:**
- Review of a data breach case like Cambridge Analytica, focusing on lessons learned and preventive measures.

### Bias and Fairness in AI

Examine how AI algorithms can perpetuate or even amplify biases present in training data. Discuss the implications of biased AI in decision-making contexts like hiring or law enforcement, and explore strategies for mitigation.

**Examples:**
- Example case: An AI hiring tool that inadvertently discriminates against certain demographics.

### Accountability and Transparency in AI

Discuss the challenges of assigning responsibility when AI systems cause harm or make incorrect decisions. The importance of explainable AI and the role of human oversight is also covered.

**Examples:**
- Example: Autonomous vehicles and the question of liability in accidents.

**Videos:**

- [Case Study: AI Bias](https://www.example.com/video2): A detailed analysis of a real-world case of AI bias, highlighting how it was identified and addressed.

**Additional Readings:**
- [Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/): A comprehensive entry from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on the ethics of AI and robotics.
- [The Future of Privacy](https://www.example.com/future-of-privacy): An article discussing the evolving nature of privacy concerns in the age of AI and big data.

**Assignments:**
- Identify and Analyze Ethical Issues: Select an AI technology of your choice and identify its potential ethical issues. Analyze these issues using one of the ethical frameworks discussed in class.
  - **Hints:** Choose a technology you've read about recently. Consider what ethical concerns make headlines and why.
  - **Solutions:** Example solution: Autonomous drones might raise issues about privacy (surveillance) and accountability (damage or injury caused). Using the deontological framework, the focus should be on the rights and duties involved, such as the right to privacy.

- Case Study Review: Review a provided case study on AI bias in healthcare. Summarize the main issues and propose strategies for mitigating bias.
  - **Hints:** Focus on patient data, diagnosis accuracy, and the diversity of the training dataset.
  - **Solutions:** The case highlights biased diagnostic tools due to training on non-diverse datasets. Mitigation strategies include diversifying training data and implementing regular fairness audits.
